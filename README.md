## Why React 18 and Tailwind CSS 3.4.17?

- **React 18:**  
  React 19 is still in the canary release, and using it may cause compatibility issues with `shadcn/ui`. React 18 ensures stability and avoids these risks.

- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.17:**  
  Tailwind v4 is in canary release and may lead to dependency issues with components of `shadcn/ui`. Version 3.4.17 is stable and avoids such conflicts.
